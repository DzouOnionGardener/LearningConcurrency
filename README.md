# LearningConcurrency

Although, I've worked with concurrency before in a class setting, it was all but brief and rushed. The purpose here is for me to take a deep dive into learning concurrency from start to finish, I will be uploading every little side example from the book, [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Practical-Multithreading/dp/1933988770), that I am studying from.
